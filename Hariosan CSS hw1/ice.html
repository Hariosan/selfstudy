             <p>
                The concept of Nibiru was popularized by writer Zecharia Sitchin in his books, especially The 12th Planet (1976).
               <p>
                Sitchin claimed that ancient Sumerian texts described a distant planet named Nibiru.
               </p>
               <p>
                According to his interpretation, Nibiru is part of our solar system but has an enormous, elliptical orbit that brings it close to Earth only once every 3,600 years.
               </p>
               <p>
                Sitchin also theorized that Nibiru is home to a race of advanced extraterrestrial beings called the Anunnaki.
               </p>
               <p>
                According to his writings, the Anunnaki supposedly came to Earth thousands of years ago, seeking gold and other resources, and they genetically engineered humans as a slave species to help them mine these resources. Although this theory has no basis in actual Sumerian texts, it became popular and inspired numerous conspiracy theories.
