                Black Knight Satelite
            </h3>
                <p>
                The Black Knight Satellite Theory proposes that theres an ancient alien satellite in orbit around Earth, known as the "Black Knight." 
                Believers say its been silently monitoring humanity for thousands of years and that its existence has been covered up by space agencies and governments.
               </p>
               <p>
                he theory began when inventor Nikola Tesla reported hearing a repeating radio signal while experimenting with wireless energy. 
                Some conspiracy theorists claim this signal came from the Black Knight, which they believe was broadcasting signals as it orbited Earth.
               </p>
               <p>
                In the 1960s, scientists and military personnel observed unusual objects in Earths orbit that couldnt be explained. 
                Some of these sightings were attributed to Soviet spy satellites, but others remained unexplained and fed into the Black Knight mystery.
                </p>
               <p>
                According to believers, the Black Knight was placed in orbit by an ancient extraterrestrial civilization to monitor Earth and observe human development. 
                Some say its been there for over 13,000 years, which would make it one of the oldest artificial objects around our planet.
               </p>
               <p>
                Over the years, amateur radio operators have claimed to intercept unexplained signals and radio waves that seem to come from an unknown source in Earths orbit. 
                Conspiracy theorists often link these signals to the Black Knight.
             </p>
              <h3>
                    Cover-Up Claims and Government Secrecy
              </h3>
             <p>
                NASA and other space agencies maintain that the object known as the Black Knight is either space debris, a thermal blanket lost during a mission, or just misidentified.
             </p>
             <p>
                However, conspiracy theorists argue that these agencies know more than theyre sharing and are actively covering up the satellites true origin.
